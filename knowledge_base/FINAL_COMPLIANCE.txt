4. CALL 911 if spill is >25 gallons or poses immediate danger

CONTAINMENT (5-15 minutes):
1. Use absorbent booms to prevent spread
2. Apply clay absorbent or sand around perimeter
3. Never use water to flush petroleum products
4. Block storm drains and waterways

CLEANUP & REPORTING:
- EPA National Response Center: 1-800-424-8802 (spills >100 gallons)
- State Environmental Agency within 24 hours
- Document everything with photos and written report

EQUIPMENT NEEDED:
- Ullage tape/stick (calibrated monthly)
- Digital temperature gauge
- Water detection paste
- Ullage log tablet/sheets
- Tank capacity charts

MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE:
1. Allow tanks to settle minimum 30 minutes after last activity

4. Record ullage depth to nearest 1/8 inch
5. Take temperature reading at mid-tank level
6. Check for water contamination using detection paste
7. Record all measurements in ullage log system immediately

INVENTORY CALCULATIONS:
- Use tank-specific capacity charts for ullage-to-gallons conversion
- Apply temperature correction factors per API standards
- Calculate daily variance: Previous + Deliveries - Sales - Current
- Investigate any variance >0.5% of tank capacity
- Document all discrepancies with photos and notes

QUALITY CONTROL:
- Weekly calibration check of measuring equipment
- Monthly verification of tank capacity charts
- Immediate investigation of variances >1.0%
- Keep ullage logs for minimum 3 years per regulations`,
