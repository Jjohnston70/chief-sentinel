## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Email Alerts Not Sending

**Symptoms:** No automated emails received, manual tests fail

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Email Quota**
   - Google Apps Script has daily email limits
   - Consumer accounts: 100 emails/day
   - Business accounts: 1,500 emails/day

2. **Verify Email Addresses**
   - Ensure all recipient emails are valid
   - Check for typos in email addresses
   - Test with a simple email first

3. **Check Trigger Status**
   - Go to Apps Script > Triggers tab
   - Verify triggers are active and not disabled
   - Check trigger execution history for errors

**Code Fix:**
```javascript
// Add error handling to email functions
try {
  MailApp.sendEmail({
    to: recipients,
    subject: subject,
    htmlBody: emailBody
  });
  Logger.log('Email sent successfully');
} catch (error) {
  Logger.log('Email error: ' + error.toString());
}
```

#### Issue: Compliance Dates Not Calculating Correctly

**Symptoms:** Wrong status colors, incorrect "days until due" calculations

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Date Formats**
   - Ensure dates are in proper format (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Verify timezone settings in Google Sheets
   - Use consistent date formatting across all sheets

2. **Verify Calculation Logic**
   - Check the `performWeeklyComplianceCheck()` function
   - Ensure alert days are set correctly
   - Verify date comparison logic

#### Issue: Ullage Calculations Incorrect

**Symptoms:** Wrong gallon calculations, variance percentages off

**Solutions:**
1. **Tank Capacity Verification**
   - Verify tank capacity values are correct
   - Check ullage-to-gallon conversion formulas
   - Ensure temperature correction factors are applied

2. **Formula Updates**
   ```javascript
   // Update ullage calculation formula
   const calculatedGallons = (tankCapacity - (ullageDepth * conversionFactor)) * temperatureCorrection;
   ```

#### Issue: Asset Tracking Data Loss

**Symptoms:** Asset information disappearing, assignment records lost

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Revision History**
   - File > Version history > See version history
   - Restore from recent backup if necessary
   - Identify when data was last correct

2. **Implement Data Validation**
   - Add dropdown lists for critical fields
   - Set up data validation rules
   - Create protected ranges for formulas
