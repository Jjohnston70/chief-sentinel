The current system covers EPA vapor testing and driver qualification well, but these additions would make it truly comprehensive for Colorado petroleum operations. The UST operational requirements are particularly critical since Colorado has an active state program that requires specific documentation and testing schedules.RetryJwhat other tools do i needEditStrategized comprehensive tools for Chief Petroleum system compliance.The user is asking about what other tools they need for their Chief Petroleum system. Given the comprehensive compliance requirements I just outlined, they'll need both software tools and physical equipment to handle all the regulatory requirements beyond their Google Sheets-based system. Let me think about this systematically:

Software/Digital Tools for compliance tracking
Physical equipment for testing and monitoring
Third-party services for certifications
Integration tools to connect different systems

The key is starting with the compliance-critical tools first (fleet management for HOS, UST monitoring for Colorado requirements) and building out from your solid Google Sheets foundation. Your current system can serve as the central dashboard while these specialized tools feed data into it.
Most importantly, ensure any new tools can export data in formats your Google Apps Script system can ingest - this maintains your unified dashboard approach while meeting regulatory requirements.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.Research Sonnet 4
